# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation. This repository collects and standardizes key processes for project delivery, risk management, release, retrospectives, and roles. These resources enable consistent, high-quality execution and onboarding across projects.

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme's project lifecycle begins with **Initiation** and **Planning**, where teams validate business needs and align stakeholders around clear objectives. The Project One-pager serves as the foundation, capturing the problem statement, success metrics, stakeholders, and initial timeline. During initiation, stakeholders make go/no-go decisions based on priority and resource availability. Planning transforms approved initiatives into actionable work by creating a prioritized backlog with clear acceptance criteria, defining the Definition of Done, and establishing sprint timelines. Teams break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies, and create release milestone maps to ensure delivery alignment.

**Execution and QA** follows a structured team rhythm with daily standups and weekly delivery syncs to maintain momentum and address blockers. Work flows through a project board from Ready to In Progress, In Review, QA, and finally Done. Quality is baked into every stage through CI/CD pipelines, peer code reviews, automated testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end), security scanning, and manual acceptance testing where needed. Small, incremental pull requests with clear acceptance criteria keep the team moving efficiently while maintaining high standards. Progress is tracked through velocity metrics and dashboards that monitor the success criteria defined in the Project One-pager.

**Risk Management, Release, and Roles** round out the OctoAcme approach. The Risk Register captures identified risks with their impact, likelihood, mitigation plans, and owners, reviewed weekly during syncs. Escalation paths are clear: team-level issues surface in standups, while cross-team dependencies escalate to the PM and Product Lead, and business-critical concerns reach the sponsor level. Release processes are standardized with automated deployment pipelines, pre-release smoke tests, documented rollback plans, and post-deployment verification. Key personas drive this system: the Project Manager coordinates delivery and risk management, the Product Lead defines outcomes and prioritizes the backlog, Developers implement features and collaborate on design, and QA validates quality against acceptance criteria. Together, these roles ensure consistent, high-quality project execution across OctoAcme.
